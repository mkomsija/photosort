# photosort
Python code for simple Photo sort (training) project.

Script used to iterate trough a folder and all its subfolders in order to sort all the individual files by month and year of last modification. Input and output folders must both exist and have valid paths.

The script can be used for any file type since there is no checking whether a file is an image (picture).
